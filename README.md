## Introduction
Welcome to the E-Commerce project, where I dive deep into the key performance indicators (KPIs) that drive the success of an online business. In this comprehensive analysis, I will explore the profit, sales, order quantity, category, and market trends that have shaped the performance thus far. By examining these KPIs, I aim to gain valuable insights that will inform strategic decisions and drive future growth.

The dataset(CSV file) for this analysis is attached and the workspace used is _Tableau_
